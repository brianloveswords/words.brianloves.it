title: Why I tried to chose couch for badges

* HTTP/REST.
It's all JSON documents, issuer and consumer can speak directly to
the DB without going through an app server.

* partial master/master replication

* list transforms

* built in revisioning and Etag header sending for cache control.
Put couch behind Varnish or Squid. The consumer doesn't have to worry about
caching or stale badges, the hub doesn't have to worry about getting hit over
and over again for the same badge.

* people can clone the _design doc and run their own hub
